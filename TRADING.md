## Market Makers
- Market makers are individuals or firms that facilitate the trading of financial instruments, such as stocks, bonds, currencies, and derivatives, in financial markets. They play a crucial role in ensuring liquidity and efficiency in the market. Market makers accomplish this by constantly providing buy and sell quotes for certain assets, which means they are always ready to buy or sell the asset at publicly quoted prices.
- Liquidity Provision: Market makers act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, offering to buy assets from sellers and sell them to buyers, thereby providing liquidity to the market. This continuous presence helps maintain a stable flow of trading activity.
- Bid-Ask Spread: Market makers profit from the difference between the price at which they are willing to buy an asset (the bid price) and the price at which they are willing to sell it (the ask price). This difference is known as the bid-ask spread.
- Reducing Price Volatility: Market makers' constant presence and willingness to trade help reduce price volatility by smoothing out the fluctuations between bid and ask prices.
- Market Stability: In times of market stress or sudden price movements, market makers help stabilize the market by absorbing excess supply or demand, which helps prevent extreme price swings.
- Regulatory Requirements: In many financial markets, certain regulations require the presence of market makers to ensure orderly trading and fair pricing.

NOTE: 
- The spreads differ on a market’s liquidity. Thus, market makers will less likely to provide liquidity to low-volume markets because of the risks and lack of demand for the asset.
- Also, market makers will receive significantly reduced trading fees or no trading fees altogether. This is the second-way market makers like Wintermute make money.

Notes in my own words

- if there are not enough parties to buy a product then the BID price goes down and then the market is considered as illiquid because there is not enough buyers for the product.
- In order to guarantee liquidity exchangers ask professionals to continuously provide a BID-ASK spread to the market. 
- These professionals make market because they are responsible for the flow of the market now
- Market makers do not have the opinion whether the price of the market should go up or down
- They make the money in the BID-ASK price, which is called the spread
- Market makers maintain the liquidity
- In Ny market makers are called specialists
- Bid is the price market makers buys at and offer/ask is the price market maker sells at
- When there are more market makers then the spread is lower, spread is the profit of the market maker
- Lets assume Harry is a market maker, and XYZ is the shares name
- SO market makers try to buy/bid the XYZ for £100 from users
- then market makers sell the same XYZ shares for £120, here they made a profit/spread of £20
- Non famous shares have the wider spread

## Liquidity
- Liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset or security can be quickly and easily bought or sold in the market without causing significant price changes. In other words, it represents the ability to convert an asset into cash or its equivalent with minimal impact on its price. Highly liquid assets are those that can be traded swiftly and with minimal transaction costs, while illiquid assets may take longer to sell and might incur higher costs.
- Importance: Liquidity is a crucial aspect of financial markets because it ensures that buyers and sellers can transact efficiently without experiencing excessive delays or price fluctuations. It enhances market efficiency, facilitates price discovery, and attracts more participants.
- Liquidity and Volatility: Liquidity is closely related to price volatility. Assets with higher liquidity tend to have more stable prices because large trading volumes can absorb buying and selling pressures without causing substantial price swings.
- Bid-Ask Spread: The bid-ask spread is an indicator of liquidity. In liquid markets, the spread between the buying price (bid) and the selling price (ask) is relatively narrow, indicating minimal trading costs. In illiquid markets, the spread tends to be wider, reflecting the higher costs associated with trading those assets.

Notes in my own words

What is liquidity in crypto
- Buying and selling is difficult with low liquidity, just like it is hard to swim in shallow water (Less depth)
- Crypto needs certain amount of trading volume to ensure liquidity
Liquidity is the ease with which you can either convert your crypto or cash it out.
- It is more like the flow of cash or the amount of cash flowing in crypto
- More cash is flowing, easier it is to trade crypto
- When there is more flow then conversions into cash or other crypto will not significantly change the price of the market or that particular crypto
- Just like that if you’re swimming in a small pool your movements will have the large effects in the water and very little effect if you are swimming in the ocean


- Bit coin is a highly liquid asset, we can easily buy and sell bitcoin with minimal impact on its price
- Spread is the amount seller is selling and buyer is willing to pay
- More assets available in the pool, the more liquid it is


Slippage
- The concept of spread is also related to another common occurrence in Volatile or illiquid markets is slippage.
- Where a trader receive a different price to what they were original intended to receive.
- This happens when there is change in spread at the time when order is placed and when the order is executed.
- This is more likely o happen where markets are illiquid and price swings occur more easily
- Slippage can be +ve or -ve
- With high liquid market slippage does not happen often.

## What is HFT (High Frequency Trading)

- Computers/algorithms trade nowadays instead of humans.
- Algorithms are much faster than the the humans, and HFT means trade as much and as quickly as possible.
- HFT are only make a little proportion of the market but are responsible for the 2/3 of the market's behaviour.
- Profit on each transaction is very small, but the number of transactions are super high, so it adds up to billions due to mass and velocity.
- A market has a high level of liquidity with HFT's
- HFT is super fast, fast enough to beat classic trading machines and humans.
- Not everyone can afford a HFT 
- Quote stuffing is done by the HFT to slow down the speed of other machines/traders by offering un-necessary offers and divert their attention or focus from important offers.
- Another manipulation technique is called spoofing
- A trading program will generate a number of overpriced purchase offers, since the HFT are super fast, they will cancel the purchase offer before anyone purchases them and generate a fake demand at high price. These are phantom offers create an illusion that number of dealers are interested in buying the offers
 and the prices for these good will soon rise significantly. Other dealers react to this illusion and making sure that the price does rise.
- The Spoofer now uses previously acquired options bought at un-manipulated price to make significant profit.
- Their behaviour can be unpredicatble sometimes and they can cause market to crash within a couple of minutes.

- Slow machines are at an disadvantage when there are quote stuffing and spoofing.
- Parliament said that we should not do this a lot.
- Market can become fair with minimum number number of offer cancellations or Introducing minimum holding period for offers.
- European parliament has proposed 500 milli seconds as the minimum retention period, this way market is more fair and less powerful algorithms are less in damage. HFT's will not be able to retain their fake offers for too long. But was unsuccesfful in this initiative

## What is Algo trading
- Trading is done using computer code
- There are no emotions
- Increased activity
- Saving time on analysis
- Quicker execution



NOTE: The core difference between HFT and algo trading is that algorithmic trading is designed for the long-term, while high-frequency trading (HFT) allows one to buy and sell at a very fast rate. The use of these methods became very common since they beat the human capacity making it a far superior option.

## OTC trading (Over the counter)
- The trade takes place between two parties directly rather than through a formal exchange, such as through a NYC stock exchange.
- Less buyers available, or seller needs to reduce the selling price to sell something (Which is frustating for the seller)
- Prices are not publicaly disclosed
